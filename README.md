## About This Starter

- Uses our [`@agility/next`](https://github.com/agility/agility-next) package to make getting started with Agility CMS and Next.js easy
- Connected to a sample Agility CMS Instance for sample content & pages
- Uses the `getStaticProps` function from Next.js to allow for full SSG (Static Site Generation)
- Supports [`next/image`](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image) for image optimization
- Supports full [Page Management](https://help.agilitycms.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055805831)
- Supports Preview Mode
- Uses `revalidate` tag with Vercel to enable [ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#incremental-static-regeneration) builds
- Provides a functional structure that dynamically routes each page based on the request, loads a Page Templates dynamically, and also dynamically loads and renders appropriate Agility CMS Page Modules (as React components)

### Tailwind CSS

This starter uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), a simple and lightweight utility-first CSS framework packed with classes that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.

It also comes equipped with [Autoprefixer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/autoprefixer), a plugin which use the data based on current browser popularity and property support to apply CSS prefixes for you.

### TypeScript

This starter supports [TypeScript](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/typescript) out of the box. If you would like to use TypeScript in your project, simply rename your files with a `.ts` extension to start taking advantage of Typescript concepts such as types and interfaces to help describe your data.

## Running the Site Locally

### Development Mode

When running your site in `development` mode, you will see the latest content in real-time from the CMS.

#### yarn

1. `yarn install`
2. `yarn dev`

To update content locally without restarting your dev server, run `yarn cms-pull`

To clear your content cache locally, run `yarn cms-clear`

#### npm

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`

To update content locally without restarting your dev server, run `npm run cms-pull`

To clear your content cache locally, run `npm run cms-clear`

### Production Mode

When running your site in `production` mode, you will see the published from the CMS.

#### yarn

1. `yarn build`
2. `yarn start`

#### npm

1. `npm run build`
2. `npm run start`

## Accessing Content
Content get's passed to your Agility Page Modules as `props`, but you can also use the built in API to access. The API will first try to access the [Sync SDK](https://github.com/agility/agility-sync-sdk) to see if any content is saved locally. If no content is stored locally, the API will fallback to our [REST API](https://agilitydocs.netlify.app/agility-content-fetch-js-sdk/1.1.1/index.html).

Some common calls to the Sync SDK include: `getContentItem`, `getContentList`, and `getSitemap`.

### getSitemap Parameters
- `channelName`, string, *required* - The contentID of the requested item in this locale.
- `languageCode`, string, *required* - The reference name of the Sitemap in Agility to return.

### getContentItem Parameters
- `contentID`, integer, *required* - The contentID of the requested item in this locale.
- `languageCode`, string, *required* - The locale code you want to retrieve content for.
- `depth`, integer - The maximum level to expand linked content from this item (Sync SDK).
- `contentLinkDepth` - The maximum level to expand linked content from this item (REST API).
- `expandAllContentLinks`, boolean - Whether or not to expand entire linked content references, includings lists and items that are rendered in the CMS as Grid or Link.

### getContentList Parameters
- `referenceName`, string, *required* - The unique reference name of the content list you wish to retrieve in the current locale. Reference names must be ALL lowercase.
- `languageCode`, string, *required* - The locale code you want to retrieve content for.
- `depth`, integer - The depth of list items (Sync SDK).
- - `contentLinkDepth` - The maximum level to expand linked content from this item (REST API).
- `expandAllContentLinks`, boolean - Whether or not to expand entire linked content references, includings lists and items that are rendered in the CMS as Grid or Link.

## Deploying Your Site

The easiest way to deploy a Next.js website to production is to use [Vercel](http://vercel.com/) from the creators of Next.js. Vercel is an all-in-one platform with Global CDN supporting static & Jamstack deployment and Serverless Functions.

By clicking the button above, you can get this starter repo deployed to Vercel with a Preview Environment within minutes! It will prompt you to enter your `AGILITY_GUID`, `AGILITY_API_FETCH_KEY`, `AGILITY_API_PREVIEW_KEY` and your `AGILITY_SECURITY_KEY`.

## Notes

### How to Register Page Modules

1. To create a new Page Module, create a new React component within the `/components/agility-pageModules` directory.
2. All of the Page Modules that are being used within the site need to be imported into the `index` file within the `/components/agility-pageModules` directory and added to the `allModules` array:

```
import RichTextArea from "./RichTextArea";
import FeaturedPost from "./FeaturedPost";
import PostsListing from "./PostsListing";
import PostDetails from "./PostDetails";
import Heading from "./Heading";
import TextBlockWithImage from "./TextBlockWithImage";

const allModules = [
  { name: "TextBlockWithImage", module: TextBlockWithImage },
  { name: "Heading", module: Heading },
  { name: "FeaturedPost", module: FeaturedPost },
  { name: "PostsListing", module: PostsListing },
  { name: "PostDetails", module: PostDetails },
  { name: "RichTextArea", module: RichTextArea },
];
```

### How to Register Page Templates

1. To create a new Page Template, create a new React component within the `/components/agility-pageTemplates` directory.
2. All of the Page Template that are being used within the site need to be imported into the `index` file within the `/components/agility-pageTemplates` directory and added to the `allTemplates` array:

```
import MainTemplate from "./MainTemplate";

const allTemplates = [
  { name: "MainTemplate", template: MainTemplate }
];
```

### How to Properly Link to an Internal Page

To link to internal pages, use the `next/link` component.

```
import Link from 'next/link';

<Link href="/posts">
  <a>{item.fields.title}</a>
</Link>
```

### How to Preview Content

Since this is a static site, how can editors preview content in real-time as they are making edits within Agility CMS? Vercel supports Previews out of the box! Simply paste the address of your site deployed on Vercel into your Agility Sitemap Configuration (Settings > Sitemaps), and use it as your Preview Deployment.
